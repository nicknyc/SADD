# SADD
Assistive Technology for blinds

Nowaday, The blind especial the blind from birth have problems about learning and writing an alphabet because they can’t see an alphabet so they can’t write an alphabet. They can’t contact a financial transactions with themselve because they can’t sign a signature and bank don’t approve fingerprinting.
Sound-based Assistive Drawing Device or SADD will help the blind to solve this problem. SADD can generate the different sound from direction of drawing such as drawing up and down have same sound but different noise level. Drawing up has high volume and drawing down has low volume. The blind can learn an alphabet and sign a signature from this sound instead of using eyesight. We think that SADD has benefits for both the blind and low vision. In addition to benefit about sign a signature, SADD help learning about drawing from remember by looking to remember by hearing.

Our team has designed the device as a picture below consisted of two part, first a sensor unit which is attached to pen or pencil and second a control unit which wired to the sensor unit and has a 3.5mm headphone jack to plug user earphone or headphone in.

Inside the sensor unit there is a 3-axis Accelerometer which determine the position of pen or pencil and send the value to the control unit.
The control unit which is the heart of this device has a power switch on its lit which you can open and put 2 AA battery to power the device.
Arduino Nano 3.0 is placed under the battery pack connected to the sensor unit, the battery switch and headphone breakout module.

In order to use the device, first open the control unit lit, place 2 AA batteries into the battery pack and close the lit. Then plug your headphone or earphone jack in the control unit, now you finished the preparing phase, after that you can switch on the device and start drawing. The sound will be played on your headphone or earphone and change its tone base on how your pen moved.
